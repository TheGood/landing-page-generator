## Tips for Better Results

- Be specific about your topic (e.g., "AI-powered meal planning app for busy professionals" instead of just "meal planning app")
- You can add constraints like "Keep it professional and B2B focused" or "Make it friendly and consumer-focused"
- If you want a specific tone, mention it: "Write in a conversational, friendly tone" or "Use a more formal, enterprise tone"
- You can ask for revisions: "Make the headlines more action-oriented" or "Add more specific numbers and metrics"

## Example Topics

- "AI-powered contract review software for legal teams"
- "Local SEO services for small businesses"
- "Executive coaching for tech startup founders"
- "Organic meal delivery service for families"
- "Cloud migration consulting for enterprise companies"
- "Personal fitness training with AI-powered workout plans"
